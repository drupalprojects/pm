UPGRADE NOTES

Currently, it is possible to upgrade directly from 7.x-1.x to 7.x-3.x.
(However, support for this may be removed in the future.)

7.x-1.x -> 7.x-2.x:

* Integration with Drupal user accounts:

  Drupal PM 7.x-2.x integrates with Drupal user accounts and no longer defines
  a PM Person content type.

* Field API:

  Drupal PM 7.x-2.x uses the Drupal Field API to define node fields, rather
  than implementing its own database storage.

* Permission changes:

  The following permissions are present in the 7.x-1.x version, but are not
  present in the 7.x-2.x version. Those permissions are obsolete because
  Drupal PM 7.x-2.x integrates with Drupal user accounts and no longer defines
  a PM Person content type.

  Project Management Person: add
  Project Management Person: delete all
  Project Management Person: delete own
  Project Management Person: delete of user organization
  Project Management Person: delete when linked to own user account
  Project Management Person: edit all
  Project Management Person: edit own
  Project Management Person: edit of user organization
  Project Management Person: view all
  Project Management Person: view own
  Project Management Person: view of user organization
  Project Management Person: view when linked to own user account

7.x-2.x - 7.x-3.x:

* Permission changes:

  The separate PM Permission module has been removed. All functionality is in
  the PM (core) module. No migration is required - permissions will be retained
  after upgrade.
